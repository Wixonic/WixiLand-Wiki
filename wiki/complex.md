The **complex** is a set of constructions designed initially as shelters for humans and certain animals that sought refuge from the [Great Cold](wiki://great-cold). After the [Derangement](wiki://derangement), it became a haven for the [Wixies](wiki://wixi). The complex consists of 12 [Silos](wiki://silo) connected by [Tubes](wiki://tube).

## History

The complex was originally created by the [Founders](wiki://founders) to protect humans, as well as some of the fauna and flora, from the [AEON reactor](wiki://AEON-reactor) explosion. The exact number of initial [Silos](wiki://silo) in the complex remains unknown, but traces of [Silo No. 17](wiki://silo-17) have been found in [Relic No. 1177](wiki://relic-1177). Today, only [Silos](wiki://silo) [No. 1](wiki://silo-1), [No. 2](wiki://silo-2), [No. 3](wiki://silo-3), [No. 5](wiki://silo-5), [No. 6](wiki://silo-6), [No. 7](wiki://silo-7), [No. 8](wiki://silo-8), [No. 9](wiki://silo-9), [No. 10](wiki://silo-10), and [No. 12](wiki://silo-12) are operational and/or accessible. [Silo No. 4](wiki://silo-4) is no longer functional, and [No. 11](wiki://silo-11) is inaccessible following [Containment Procedure 11-0](wiki://containment-procedure-x-0).

## Structure

![Simplified layout of the complex](assets://complex-layout)

Each [Silo](wiki://silo) is entirely independent, but collaboration between [Silos](wiki://silo) is permitted under the [Second Pact](wiki://second-pact), making the transport of technologies, documents, and other goods frequent in order to reduce technological disparities between the [Silos](wiki://silo).

Although cables and pipes are visible in some layouts extracted from [declassified relics](wiki://declassified-relics), the origin of the power supply and water supply remains unknown.

## Legends and Beliefs

Due to isolation after the [Derangement](wiki://derangement), the [Wixies](wiki://wixi) began to speculate about what might lie beyond the walls of the complex. This led to the emergence of various legends:
- [Belief of Level 1](wiki://belief-level-1), a belief in a potential Level 1 within each [Silo](wiki://silo).
- [Fear of Humans](wiki://fear-of-humans), a legend about the oppression of humans before the [Derangement](wiki://derangement).
