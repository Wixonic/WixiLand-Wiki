**ELEUTHIA** is a mysterious central system located at Level 40 of each [Silos](wiki://silo), with an unknown role. Created by the [Founders](wiki://founders), it is believed to be involved in the maintenance and regeneration of the [Wixies](wiki://wixi), possibly functioning as an incubator or storage system.

## Description

ELEUTHIA's exact function is unclear, but it is considered a central hub for vital processes in the [Complex](wiki://complex), as it may act as an incubator for creating or activating [Wixies](wiki://wixi).
Some areas near Level 40 (**Levels 41-45**) are closed, leading to speculation that they are directly tied to ELEUTHIA.
Entering ELEUTHIA is strictly forbidden according to the [Second Pact](wiki://second-pact).

## Myths and Beliefs

- The ELEUTHIA Door: It's believed that the door to ELEUTHIA opens periodically, giving "birth" to new [Wixies](wiki://wixi).
- The ELEUTHIA Cavern: A hidden area, filled with technological or biological secrets, is rumored to exist within the [Complex](wiki://complex).
