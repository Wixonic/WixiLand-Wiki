The **Belief of Level 1** is a widespread myth among the [[wiki/wixi | Wixies]], based on the assumption that a hidden first floor exists, though it is not officially part of the [[wiki/silo | Silo]].

## Description

The [[wiki/wixi | Wixies]] believe that the ramp leading from Level 2 may continue to an unrecognized Level 1, despite no clear evidence of such a level. This belief is fueled by the observation of a blocked ceiling on Level 2 that obstructs the ramp, creating the illusion that it could lead to something more. Some [[wiki/wixi | Wixies]] believe the ceiling is a deliberate barrier, with its true purpose obscured by the [[wiki/founders | Founders]].
