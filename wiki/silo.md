A **Silo** is an underground bunker serving as a refuge during the [Great Cold](wiki://great-cold). Buried deep underground, Silos are key components of the [Complex](wiki://complex) and are interconnected through the [Tube](wiki://tube).

## Structure

A Silo consists of 99 levels, numbered from 2 to 100, connected by a large ramp. Most of these levels are designated for housing, storage, and maintenance purposes. [Server rooms](wiki://server-rooms) for the [IT Department](wiki://it-department) are located every 10 levels, except on Levels 40 and 100. [Dumpsters](wiki://dumpsters), found every 5 levels, are interconnected and lead to the [incinerator](wiki://incinerator) on Level 99, except on Level 100.

### Notable Levels

- **Level 2**: The highest known level, with a ceiling obstructing the ramp’s path. This ceiling is central to the [Belief of Level 1](wiki://belief-of-level-1).
- **Level 12**: Houses the [Judicial Department](wiki://judicial-department).  
- **Level 13**: Contains the [IT Department](wiki://it-department).
- **Levels 20, 50, and 80**: Home to the [Cafeterias](wiki://cafeteria).
- **Level 40**: Location of [ELEUTHIA](wiki://eleuthia).
- **Levels 41-45**: These levels are closed and inaccessible, leading to speculation that they are part of [ELEUTHIA](wiki://eleuthia).
- **Levels 95–97**: Contain the [Forges](wiki://forges).
- **Level 98**: Houses the [Resource Distribution Center](wiki://wrdc).
- **Level 99**: Contains the [Recycling Center](wiki://wrc) and [incinerator](wiki://incinerator).
- **Level 100**: Contains [Bessie](wiki://bessie).

## Silo Management

Following the [Derangement](wiki://derangement), humans no longer inhabit the Silos, but the [Wixies](wiki://wixi) continue to maintain and operate infrastructure initially designed for human use, often without logical necessity. For instance, [Cafeterias](wiki://cafeteria) remain functional as communal areas, despite the Wixies not requiring food, and [Farms](wiki://farms) continue to produce food even though it is no longer needed. This behavior may stem from either automated programming protocols or cultural traditions passed down from the Silo's original creators.

Additionally, the Wixies manage the ongoing maintenance of various systems within the Silo, including:
- **Recycling and Waste Management**: All dumpsters are interconnected and lead to the [incinerator](wiki://incinerator) on Level 99, ensuring waste disposal. Recyclable materials are sent to the [Recycling Center](wiki://wrc).
- **Material Processing**: The [Forges](wiki://forges) convert raw materials delivered to the [Resource Distribution Center](wiki://wrdc) into usable components such as structural reinforcements, technological parts, and tools. The origin of these materials remains unclear, with some theories suggesting that an automated system, possibly linked to the broader [Complex](wiki://complex), ensures their steady supply.
