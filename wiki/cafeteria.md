**Cafeterias** in the [Silos](wiki://silo) are largely obsolete but remain operational under the maintenance of the [Wixies](wiki://wixi).

## Description

The cafeterias were once vital hubs for the human residents of the [Silos](wiki://silo), providing food and supplies. However, since the [Derangement](wiki://derangement), they serve little purpose, and their usage has significantly declined. [Wixies](wiki://wixi) continue to maintain these facilities, despite the fact that their original function has long been unnecessary. Today, these spaces are symbolic relics of a bygone era, preserved mostly out of routine and habit. They are located on Levels 20, 50, and 80.
